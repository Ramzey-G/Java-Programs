 *                       PURPOSE:
 * This program performs calculations on sparse Matricies. An N x N matrix is
 * sparse if the number of it's non-zero entries 
 * is small compared to the toal number (n^2) of
 * entries. The result is fast performing matrix
 * operations.
 * 
 *
 *                       FILES:
 *
 * README - this file
 *
 * Makefile - File used for automating the build process.
 *          - Makes executable Sparse file
 *
 * List.java - List ADT
 *
 * Sparse.java - takes in an input file and output file, creates two  matricies
 *                from the values in the input file, computes matrix operations
 *               and saves the output to the outputfile
 * 
 * Matrix.java - Matrix class that created matricies, and handles matrix operations
 *
 * MatrixTest.java - tester class that tests Matrix's functions
 *
 * ListTest.java - tester class that tests List's functions
 *
