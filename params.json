These programs have been written in my high school's AP Computer Science class to understand the fundamentals of the Java language. The Programs in my UNIX Folder include more advanced projects written in the UNIX command line interface, taking advantages of Makefiles for automating builds of programs, git for commiting changes, and Unit Testing to test specific parts of my code.\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out the code on GitHub by clicking the button at the upper right of the page.
